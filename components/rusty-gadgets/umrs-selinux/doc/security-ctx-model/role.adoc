## SELinux Security Role Identifier

In the SELinux vernacular, the Role (_r) acts as a gateway between the User and the Type. It is the
core component of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The SELinux Notebook

Key Functions of the Role:

Defining Authorization: A role defines which Types (domains) a process is allowed to enter. For
example, the `webadm_r` role might be authorized to run the `httpd_t` domain, but the 
standard `user_r` role is not.

Hierarchical Access: It prevents "privilege escalation" by ensuring a user cannot simply jump into
a sensitive domain (like shadow_t) unless their current Role permits that transition.

Object Placeholder: For files and static objects, the role is almost always object_r. Since files
are passive and don't "act," they don't need functional roles; object_r serves as a required
syntactical placeholder in the context string. Red Hat Documentation

Common Examples:
- sysadm_r: The system administrator role, authorized for high-privilege domains.
- staff_r: A role for users who can switch to more privileged roles (like sysadm_r) via sudo or newrole.
- user_r: A restricted role for everyday users, limited to standard applications.


## Security Role Module

This module provides an independent Rust implementation of the
`SELinux` security role construct. It models only the identifier 
primitive — not policy bindings, transitions, or authorization rules.

Kernel / Policy Sources Consulted:

- security/selinux/ss/policydb.c
- security/selinux/include/security.h
- libselinux RBAC interfaces

In `SELinux` policy, roles are symbol table entries associated with:

- Authorized domain (type) sets
- Role transition rules
- User-role authorization mappings

 Represents a validated `SELinux` security role identifier.

 Example values:

   system_r
   staff_r
   object_r


Validation rules:
- ASCII only
- No whitespace
- Character set: [a-z0-9_]
- Must end with `_r`
- on-empty identifier stem
- Length within policy bounds: 3–255 bytes

# Errors

Returns `RoleError` if:
- The identifier contains non-ASCII characters.
- The identifier contains whitespace.
- The identifier does not follow `SELinux` naming conventions.
- The identifier exceeds length constraints.
