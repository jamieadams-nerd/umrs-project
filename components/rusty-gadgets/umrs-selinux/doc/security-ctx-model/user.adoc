## SELinux Security User Identifier

In the SELinux vernacular, `user_u` is a generic, low-privilege SELinux User typically assigned to
standard, non-administrative human users. 

Key Characteristics:

**Identity Mapping:** Unlike Linux UIDs, which change between systems, user_u
is a consistent identity defined within the SELinux policy. When you log in,
the system maps your Linux username to this SELinux identity.

**Restricted Privileges:** It is designed for users who should not have
administrative access. A user mapped to user_u is generally prevented from
switching to administrative roles like sysadm_r or executing setuid binaries
that would transition them into a privileged domain.

**Role Limitation:** By default, user_u is only authorized for the user_r Role,
which limits the processes (domains) they can run to basic user applications
(e.g., shells, browsers, editors). 

Why "user_u" instead of my username? SELinux uses this abstraction to group many Linux accounts
under a single security profile. This allows an administrator to define one set of rules for "all
standard users" rather than writing individual rules for every person on the system

## UMRS SELinux User (SelinuxUser) Module 

Strongly-typed Rust primitive modeling `SELinux` security users. This module
models only the identifier primitive — not policy bindings or clearance
mappings.

Kernel / Policy Sources Consulted:
- security/selinux/include/security.h
- security/selinux/ss/policydb.c
- libselinux user mapping interfaces

In SELinux policy, users are symbol table entries associated with:
- Role authorization sets
- MLS clearance ranges
- Login mapping records


### Validation of SelinuxUser
The following represent a validated `SELinux` security user 
identifier: system_u, staff_u, and user_u

Validation rules enforced:
- ASCII only
- No whitespace
- Character set: [a-z0-9_]
- Must end in "_u"
- Non-empty identifier stem
- Length 3–255 bytes
