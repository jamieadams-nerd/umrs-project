In the SELinux vernacular, the Type is the "heavy lifter" of the security
context. It is the primary attribute used for Type Enforcement (TE), which is
the mechanism responsible for most access control decisions in the kernel.

What it Represents: The meaning of the Type changes depending on whether it is
applied to a process or an object:

For Processes (Domains): When a type is applied to a process, it is called a
Domain. It defines what that process is allowed to do. For example, a process
with the httpd_t domain is allowed to listen on network ports.

For Objects (Files/Sockets): When applied to a file, it is simply called a
Type. It defines the "category" of the data. For example, files labeled
httpd_sys_content_t are designated as web content.

How it Works (The "Sandboxing" Effect):

The policy contains rules that link these types together. A typical rule looks like:

> Allow httpd_t to read files of type httpd_sys_content_t.

If a hacker compromises the web server (httpd_t), the Type prevents them from
accessing your private SSH keys, because those keys are labeled with the
ssh_home_t type—and the policy has no "allow" rule connecting those two types.

Key Takeaway: 

While the User and Role provide a high-level framework, the Type is what
actually isolates applications and protects your data on a granular, day-to-day
basis.
