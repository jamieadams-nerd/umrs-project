Multi-Category Security (MCS) is an access control mechanism in SELinux that
provides non-hierarchical isolation between processes and objects. It is
essentially a "compartmentalization" system that allows you to tag data and
processes with categories (ranging from c0 to c1023) to ensure confidentiality. 

How MCS Works

Access Logic: A process can only access an object if it has a superset of the
object's categories. If a file is labeled with c1,c2, a process with only c1
will be denied access.

Isolation: This is widely used in containerization (like Docker or Podman) and
virtualization (sVirt). Each container is assigned a unique, random category
pair (e.g., s0:c12,c45) so that even if a process escapes the container, it
cannot access the data of another container with different categories.

Hierarchy: Unlike MLS (Multi-Level Security), MCS typically uses only a single
sensitivity level (s0), meaning there is no "Top Secret" vs. "Unclassified"
vertical ranking, only horizontal grouping. 

The Translation Daemon: mcstransd

The "daemon which translates strings" you are referring to is mcstransd (the
MCS/MLS Translation Daemon). 

Purpose: SELinux internally stores categories as raw numbers (e.g., s0:c0,c1).
These are hard for humans to read. mcstransd translates these internal
representations into human-readable labels (e.g., s0:CompanyConfidential) for
use in command outputs like ls -Z or ps -Z.

Configuration: The mappings are defined in the setrans.conf file, typically
located at /etc/selinux/{POLICYTYPE}/setrans.conf.

Example Mapping: You can define a rule in setrans.conf like s0:c0=Marketing.
When you run ls -Z, you will see Marketing instead of c0.

Communication: It communicates with libselinux via a Unix domain socket located
at /var/run/setrans/.setrans-unix. 

Pro-tip: You can see the current translations on your system by running the command: chcat -L.
