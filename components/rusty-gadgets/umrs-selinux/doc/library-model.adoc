## UMRS SELinux Modeling Library

- Project: Unclassified MLS Reference System (exploring CUI)
- Author: Jamie Adams (a.k.a, Imodium Operator)

This work represents a clean-room, strongly-typed modeling layer designed
to provide ergonomic and high-assurance abstractions over SELinux security
constructs.

Where appropriate, this implementation leverages Rust language features
such as:
- Strong typing
- Validation at construction
- Deterministic memory layout
- Ownership and borrowing guarantees

These design choices aim to improve correctness, safety, and auditability
beyond legacy approaches while preserving semantic compatibility.

## Implementation Lineage & Design Note
This crate provides an independent, original implementation of primitives
conceptually comparable to traditional SELinux userland libraries and MLS
policy constructs.

Behavioral interfaces and operational semantics were studied to ensure
familiarity for long-time SELinux developers and administrators.
However:
- No SELinux source code has been copied.
- No code has been translated from C to Rust.
- No line-by-line reimplementation has been performed.
