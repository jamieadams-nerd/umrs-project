## Sensitivity Level


In the official SELinux vernacular, the Level field (the 4th part of the context) is used for Multi-Level Security (MLS) and Multi-Category Security (MCS). It is essentially the "clearance level" of the system.

The sensitivity level defines a hierarchical "need-to-know" rank.
Format: Usually represented as s0 through s15.

How it works: It follows the Bell-LaPadula model: "No read up, no write down."
A process at sensitivity s0 cannot read a file at s1 because it doesn't have a
high enough clearance.

Common Usage: On most standard systems (like Fedora or RHEL), you will only see
s0. Higher levels are typically only used in high-security government or
military environments.
