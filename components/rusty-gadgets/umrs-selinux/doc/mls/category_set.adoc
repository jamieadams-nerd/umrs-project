## Category Set

In the official SELinux vernacular, the Level field (the 4th part of the
context) is used for Multi-Level Security (MLS) and Multi-Category Security
(MCS). It is essentially the "clearance level" of the system

Categories provide non-hierarchical, horizontal isolation (grouping).
Format: Appended to the sensitivity, like s0:c0,c100.
How it works: Even if two processes have the same sensitivity (s0), they cannot see each other's data unless their categories match or overlap.
Common Usage (MCS): This is how Docker or Virtual Machines are isolated. Each container is assigned a random, unique category (e.g., s0:c12,c45). Even if a container escapes to the host, it cannot access the files of another container because the categories don't match.

Summary of the "Level" Field

Component	Example	Purpose
Sensitivity	s0	Vertical hierarchy (Clearance)
Category	c102	Horizontal isolation (Compartments)

> Analogy: 
> If the Sensitivity is the floor number in an office building (Level
> 1, Level 2), the Category is the specific room number on that floor. You need
> to be on the right floor and have the key to that specific room to get in.
