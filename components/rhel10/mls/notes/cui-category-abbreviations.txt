Now, for the categories that are particularly relevant to UMRS (security, infra, IT, logs, etc.), here are concise descriptions based on NARA CUI Registry guidance and derivative references like DoD and university CUI explainers. 
These are paraphrased; for formal text you’d click through each category in the CUI Registry.

EXPT – Export Controlled
Information subject to U.S. export control laws such as ITAR or EAR. This includes technical data, software, or other information whose transfer to foreign persons or countries is restricted.

EXPTR – Export Controlled Research
Research data that falls under export control, often arising in academic or R&D contexts where results could be export-controlled.

CTI – Controlled Technical Information
Technical information (e.g., engineering, technical data, software) with military or space application that requires protection under specific defense-related regulations or contracts.

ISVI – Information Systems Vulnerability Information
Details about weaknesses, vulnerabilities, or exploitation paths in information systems or networks (e.g., vulnerability reports, scans) that require protection to avoid aiding adversaries.

OPSEC – Operations Security
Information whose uncontrolled exposure would undermine operational security (e.g., patterns revealing how an organization operates, schedules, specific capabilities).

PCII – Protected Critical Infrastructure Information
Critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to DHS under PCII authority, which receives special protections and handling controls.

CEII – Critical Energy Infrastructure Information
Information about energy sector infrastructure (generation, transmission, pipelines, etc.) that could be misused to disrupt services or compromise safety.

PHYS – Physical Security
Information related to physical security plans, vulnerabilities, or protective measures for facilities or assets.

HLTH – Health Information
Health-related personal information requiring protection, often overlapping with HIPAA concepts (e.g., medical records or health status).

PRVCY – General Privacy
General personally identifiable information (PII) that requires safeguarding but isn’t covered by a more specific privacy category.

MIL – Military Personnel Records
Personnel data for military members that requires safeguarding (assignments, performance, non-public details, etc.).

PERS – Personnel Records
Similar to MIL but broader: personnel records for non-military staff or employees.

STUD – Student Records
Educational records subject to privacy or FERPA-like protections.

GENETIC – Genetic Information
Information about genetic tests or characteristics (DNA, inherited traits) that are individually identifiable and protected.
