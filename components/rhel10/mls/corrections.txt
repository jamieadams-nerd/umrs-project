Good — thank you for pasting the JSON. I will **disregard sensitivity levels entirely** and focus **only on CUI correctness** (categories, subcategories, names, abbreviations, placement) relative to the **NARA CUI Registry**, exactly as requested.

I am treating the pasted file as the authoritative input under review .

Below is a **structured audit** broken into:

1. **Definite errors (must fix)**
2. **Incorrect or non-registry entries (must remove or reclassify)**
3. **Missing registry entries (if you want full coverage)**
4. **Structural / consistency issues (important for UMRS)**

I am being very explicit so this can stabilize your taxonomy.

---

1. DEFINITE ERRORS (OBJECTIVELY WRONG PER NARA REGISTRY)

---

A. ❌ CUI//AGR/WATER — WRONG CATEGORY AND WRONG NAME

• This entry **does not exist** under Agriculture in the NARA registry.
• “Water” as CUI is **Critical Infrastructure**, not Agriculture.
• The **correct descriptive name** is **“Water Assessments”**, not “Water”.

Action:

* REMOVE `CUI//AGR/WATER`
* ADD `CUI//CRIT/WATER`
  Name: **Water Assessments**
  Abbreviation: **WATER** (registry uses WATER as the token)

This is the exact issue you correctly called out earlier.

---

B. ❌ CUI//CRIT//CEII — INVALID PATH SYNTAX

You have:

```
CUI//CRIT//CEII
```

Double slash is invalid in registry structure.

Correct form:

```
CUI//CRIT/CEII
```

Name is fine: **Critical Energy Infrastructure Information**

Action:

* Fix path delimiter

---

C. ❌ Several top-level categories missing parent_group = "CUI"

These should all have parent_group = "CUI", but currently do not:

• CUI//GOVT
• CUI//OPSEC
• CUI//PRIVACY
• CUI//PROPIN
• CUI//PROT
• CUI//PSEC
• CUI//TechInfo

They are all **top-level CUI categories** in the registry.

Action:

* Set `parent_group: "CUI"` for all of the above

---

2. NON-REGISTRY OR MISPLACED ENTRIES (NEED REVIEW / REMOVAL)

---

These entries are **not valid NARA CUI Registry categories as written**, or are incorrectly scoped.

A. ❌ CUI//TechInfo

There is **no “TechInfo” category** in the NARA registry.

Likely confusion with:
• CTI (Controlled Technical Information)
• PROPIN
• Export-controlled research

Action:

* REMOVE `CUI//TechInfo`
* Reclassify content under **CTI**, **PROPIN**, or **EXPORT CONTROL** as appropriate

---

B. ⚠️ CUI//MGT

“MGT” does **not exist as a standalone registry category**.

Registry uses **specific management-related categories**, not a general “MGT”.

Action:

* REMOVE unless you are intentionally creating a **non-registry extension**
* If extension, it should be clearly flagged as UMRS-custom, not registry-based

---

C. ⚠️ CUI//GOVT subcategories are incomplete and vague

Examples:
• GOVTD
• GAF

These are **abbreviations without descriptive fidelity** to registry names.

Registry GOVT categories are very specific (e.g., budget execution, federal records).

Action:

* Either:

  * Expand to correct registry names
  * Or temporarily remove until you can align them precisely

---

3. MISSING REGISTRY CATEGORIES (IF YOU WANT COMPLETENESS)

---

You are missing several **major registry families** that *do* exist in NARA, depending on how complete you want UMRS to be.

Commonly missing ones include:

• CUI//TRANSPORT (Aviation, maritime, pipeline, etc.)
• CUI//EMERGENCY (separate from CRIT/EMGT)
• CUI//INTEL (non-classified intelligence CUI)
• CUI//EXPORT (non-CTI export-controlled information)
• CUI//FEDCON (Federal contract information distinct from procurement)

Important note:
You **do not need to include all of these** unless UMRS is trying to be a full registry mirror — but they *do* exist.

---

4. STRUCTURAL / UMRS-RELEVANT CONSISTENCY ISSUES

---

These are not “wrong”, but they will cause you pain later if not corrected.

A. Inconsistent use of descriptive names

Examples:
• “PCI”, “TOX”, “GAF” used as names
• Registry names are **plain-English descriptive**, not abbreviations

UMRS recommendation:

* `name` should always be the **full registry descriptive name**
* `abbrv_name` should carry the short token

---

B. Parent group hierarchy must be strictly two-level

Registry structure is:

```
CUI
 └── CATEGORY
     └── SUBCATEGORY
```

You should **never** have:
• orphaned subcategories
• categories whose parent is empty
• more than one semantic level below CUI

Your JSON is *mostly* good here — the fixes above will clean it up.

---

## SUMMARY — THE BIG THREE YOU WERE FEELING

You were absolutely right to feel instability. The core problems are:

1. **Water was miscategorized and misnamed**
2. **Several entries are not actually in the NARA registry**
3. **Top-level category parentage is inconsistent**

If you want, next steps I can do cleanly and deterministically:

• Produce a **corrected JSON diff** (only changed lines)
• Produce a **registry-faithful minimal CUI set** (no extras)
• Produce a **UMRS-extended set** with explicit “registry vs extension” tagging
• Help you lock abbreviations so they *never drift again*

You are doing the hard part correctly — this is exactly where precision matters.
