You’re not crazy — the “CUI_” prefix was just something I floated as an option, and it is making things noisier than it needs to be.



Your preference (“cleaner labels without the CUI_ prefix”) is absolutely fine and actually matches how the DoD / NARA abbreviations are usually written: CTI, EXPT, PRVCY, PROPIN, PROCURE, etc. 



So let’s lock that in:



C0 will be the umbrella “CUI” category.
C1…Cn will be the actual CUI sub-categories (PRVCY, EXPT, PROPIN, …).
All labels UPPERCASE.
No “CUI_” prefix.
Blank line before each group, and a comment describing the group.




Per your request, I’ll give you just the C-side definitions here, with no S-levels. In your real setrans.conf you’ll splice in whatever S-levels you’ve already defined (for example, you might later turn “c0=CUI” into “s4:c0=CUI” or similar). The actual SELinux syntax uses “sX:cY=NAME” lines, but we’ll keep this as a category-only template so you can wire in your S-levels yourself. 



Here’s a starter setrans.conf fragment in plain text, using the abbreviations from the CUI registry/DoD docs and your formatting rules:





BASE CUI UMBRELLA





c0=CUI





PRIVACY / PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)





c1=PRVCY      # GENERAL PRIVACY

c2=CONTRACT   # PRIVACY – CONTRACT USE

c3=DREC       # PRIVACY – DEATH RECORDS

c4=GENETIC    # PRIVACY – GENETIC INFORMATION

c5=HLTH       # PRIVACY – HEALTH INFORMATION

c6=PRIIG      # PRIVACY – INSPECTOR GENERAL PROTECTED

c7=MIL        # PRIVACY – MILITARY PERSONNEL RECORDS

c8=PERS       # PRIVACY – PERSONNEL RECORDS

c9=STUD       # PRIVACY – STUDENT RECORDS





PROCUREMENT AND ACQUISITION





c10=PROCURE   # GENERAL PROCUREMENT AND ACQUISITION

c11=SBIZ      # SMALL BUSINESS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY

c12=SSEL      # SOURCE SELECTION





PROPRIETARY BUSINESS INFORMATION





c20=PROPIN    # GENERAL PROPRIETARY BUSINESS INFORMATION

c21=MFC       # PROPRIETARY MANUFACTURER INFORMATION





EXPORT CONTROL / TECHNICAL INFORMATION





c30=CTI       # CONTROLLED TECHNICAL INFORMATION

c31=EXPT      # EXPORT CONTROLLED

c32=EXPTR     # EXPORT CONTROLLED RESEARCH





CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE / PHYSICAL SECURITY





c40=CRIT      # GENERAL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION

c41=DCRIT     # DOD CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY INFO

c42=EMGT      # EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

c43=PHYS      # PHYSICAL SECURITY

c44=ISVI      # INFORMATION SYSTEMS VULNERABILITY INFO





OPERATIONS SECURITY





c50=OPSEC     # OPERATIONS SECURITY INFORMATION





NAVAL NUCLEAR / SPECIAL ENERGY





c60=NNPI      # NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION INFORMATION

c61=CEII      # CRITICAL ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION





MISCELLANEOUS SPECIAL CATEGORIES (EXAMPLES)





c70=PSEC      # SECRECY ORDERS

c71=PROT      # TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS

c72=RAIL      # RAILROAD SAFETY ANALYSIS RECORDS



A few clarifications so we stay in sync:



Why no “CUI_” prefix?
The registry itself uses bare abbreviations like PRVCY, PROPIN, PROCURE, CTI, EXPT, etc. There’s no requirement to prepend “CUI_”, and having that extra noise in your label (“CUI_PROPIN”) doesn’t buy you anything if you already know that all of these MCS categories live under your C0=CUI umbrella.  

How you’ll actually use these with MLS:
In real setrans.conf for MLS/MCS, each line is of the form:
sX:cY=HUMAN_LABEL
where X is the sensitivity level and Y the category number.  
Since you already have your S-levels defined, you’ll effectively transform the template above into something like:
s4:c0=CUI
s4:c1=PRVCY
s4:c2=CONTRACT
…
Or, if you want the same category names visible at multiple sensitivities, you’ll replicate the c-lines under each S-level as needed.

About the “full hundred-plus”:
The authoritative full list of categories and abbreviations lives in the NARA CUI Registry plus DoD’s “CUI Categories and Abbreviations” site.  
Right now I can’t fetch that master table directly (the DoD page is not coming through this interface), so I can’t safely dump an “authoritative 100+ mapping” without risking wrong or missing codes.
What I can do is keep extending this template with additional categories as we go, based on the NIEM CUI basic codes and the public registry category pages. That’s essentially what we’ve started here.





If you want next step, we can:



Pick the next organizational group (e.g., Immigration, Finance, Legal, etc.), and
Add another block of c-lines in the same style (uppercase labels, blank line, comment header).




But, bottom line: yes, we are going with clean, uppercase abbreviations (PRVCY, EXPT, PROPIN, etc.) with no “CUI_” prefix.
