# Unclassified hierarchical levels (lowest → highest):

#
# s0 GENERAL:
#    The broad “general unclassified” level — suitable for anything openly 
#    unclassified, routine, not requiring special controls.
#
# s1 PUBLIC
#    Intended for material that is still unclassified but suitable for public 
#    dissemination, documentation, public website assets, etc.
#
# s2 SENSTIVE
#    Unclassified but sensitive material that is not meant for public posting. 
#    Internal business operations, mild sensitivities, etc.#
#
# s3 INTERNAL
#    Internal-use unclassified information that is still above the purely 
#    sensitive level. This covers items where integrity matters more strongly 
#    (engineering docs, config examples, internal processes).
#
# s4 CONTROLLED
#    he top of the unclassified-only MLS hierarchy. Used for information 
#    aligned with CUI-like requirements — unclassified, but subject to explicit 
#    handling, integrity, and confidentiality expectations. This level models 
#    what many organizations approximate as “CUI” within an unclassified environment.
