Yes. Here is a clean, “start today” way to begin AsciiDoc in a UMRS git repo and produce:



GitHub Pages static web docs
One or more PDFs (also shipped on the workstation)
Man pages (when needed)




This keeps one source of truth and generates everything as build outputs.



A) Repository layout (recommended starter)



docs/
antora.yml
modules/
ROOT/
nav.adoc
pages/
index.adoc
getting-started.adoc
install.adoc
admin-guide.adoc
security-model.adoc
operations.adoc
troubleshooting.adoc
release-notes.adoc

attachments/
umrs-reference-workstation-pdf/   (optional: final PDFs copied here by CI)




man/
umrs-state.1.adoc
umrs-audit-snapshot.8.adoc
umrs-verify.1.adoc

tools/
build-docs.sh

site/               (generated; do not hand-edit; usually gitignored)
dist/
pdf/              (generated PDFs)
man/              (generated man pages)





Why this structure:



Antora is a common choice for versioned AsciiDoc doc sites (docs-as-code).  
Man pages are a first-class Asciidoctor output (manpage backend).  
PDFs are straightforward with asciidoctor-pdf.  




B) Minimal Antora config to get a web doc site



docs/antora.yml (component descriptor)






name: umrs
title: Unclassified MLS Reference System
version: latest
nav:
modules/ROOT/nav.adoc







docs/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc







xref:index.adoc[Home]


xref:getting-started.adoc[Getting Started]


xref:install.adoc[Install]


xref:admin-guide.adoc[Administrator Guide]


xref:security-model.adoc[Security Model]


xref:operations.adoc[Operations]


xref:troubleshooting.adoc[Troubleshooting]


xref:release-notes.adoc[Release Notes]







Create docs/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc as your landing page.




C) Build outputs (one command produces all artifacts)

Create tools/build-docs.sh that does these steps:



Web site (HTML)






Use Antora to build into ./site
Antora assembles an HTML site from AsciiDoc content in git repos.  






PDFs






Use asciidoctor-pdf to build one or more PDFs into ./dist/pdf
asciidoctor-pdf converts AsciiDoc directly to PDF.  




Practical approach for “multiple PDFs”:



Make a small set of top-level “book” entrypoints, e.g.:
docs/modules/ROOT/pages/admin-guide.adoc (single PDF)
docs/modules/ROOT/pages/security-model.adoc (single PDF)

Or create dedicated PDF entry files under docs/ (recommended), e.g.:
docs/pdf-admin-guide.adoc
docs/pdf-ops-guide.adoc
Those entry files can include other pages via include:: to assemble book-style PDFs.







Man pages






Write each man page source as AsciiDoc with doctype manpage.
Build with asciidoctor using the manpage backend; Asciidoctor documents this flow and uses it for its own man page.  




D) GitHub Pages publishing (simple and reliable)

Two common options:



Option 1: Publish from /docs on main



GitHub Pages can publish from a /docs folder on a branch.  
Downside: your generated HTML must live in /docs, which mixes source and output.




Option 2 (recommended): Publish from a gh-pages branch



Keep sources on main.
CI builds the site and pushes only the generated ./site output to gh-pages.
This keeps main clean and makes it obvious what is source vs generated.




E) Shipping PDFs and man pages onto the “reference workstation”

For your RPM packaging workflow:



PDFs:
Install to /usr/share/doc/umrs/ (or /usr/share/doc/umrs/pdf/)
This is the standard “offline doc payload” location.

Man pages:
Install generated man pages into:
/usr/share/man/man1/ for user commands
/usr/share/man/man8/ for admin commands

Then run mandb (normally handled by packaging scripts).





F) A very small “start now” checklist



Add one page: docs/modules/ROOT/pages/getting-started.adoc
Add Antora files: docs/antora.yml and docs/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc
Add one man source: man/umrs-state.1.adoc (doctype manpage)
Add one PDF entrypoint: docs/pdf-admin-guide.adoc
Add tools/build-docs.sh that outputs:
site/ (HTML site)
dist/pdf/*.pdf
dist/man/*.[1-9]





If you want, I will write the exact initial file contents (antora.yml, nav.adoc, a starter index.adoc, one PDF entrypoint, and one manpage .adoc) and a hardened build-docs.sh suitable for your RHEL 10 FIPS workstation workflow.
