Terminology

Below are clear, precise, defensible definitions for the key terms you and I keep using. These are written in plain engineering language, aligned with how the terms are used in standards, forensics, auditing, and high-assurance systems, not marketing.

Where helpful, I anchor the definition to how bodies like National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), digital forensics practice, or PKI usage actually interpret them.

⸻

Provenance

Definition
Provenance is the documented history of an artifact describing where it originated, how it was produced, and how it has changed over time.

Key properties
	•	Origin: who or what created the artifact
	•	Lineage: transformations applied (format conversion, aggregation, filtering)
	•	Context: when, where, and under what authority it was created or modified

Important distinction
Provenance answers:
“Where did this come from, and how did it get here?”

Provenance alone does not guarantee correctness or legitimacy. It only establishes traceable history.

In high-assurance systems
Provenance must be:
	•	Tamper-evident
	•	Attributable (human, system, or device identity)
	•	Preserved across transformations

⸻

Attestation

Definition
Attestation is a cryptographic or authoritative assertion by an entity that a specific claim is true at a specific time.

Examples of claims
	•	“This file was received intact at time T”
	•	“This configuration matches policy X”
	•	“This system was in state Y when measured”
	•	“This data was produced by process Z”

Important distinction
Attestation answers:
“I assert this is true, and I am accountable for that assertion.”

Attestation ≠ provenance
	•	Provenance describes history
	•	Attestation asserts a fact

In high-assurance systems
Attestations should be:
	•	Cryptographically bound to the artifact or measurement
	•	Non-repudiable (the signer cannot plausibly deny it)
	•	Explicit about what is being attested (custody, integrity, state — not meaning or correctness)

⸻

Integrity

Definition
Integrity is the assurance that data has not been altered in an unauthorized or undetected manner.

What integrity means
	•	The bits are the same as when last trusted
	•	Any change is detectable
	•	Authorized changes are attributable

What integrity does not mean
	•	It does not mean the data is correct
	•	It does not mean the data is appropriate
	•	It does not mean the data is authorized for use

Integrity answers:
“Has this changed since it was last trusted?”

In practice
Integrity is enforced with:
	•	Cryptographic hashes
	•	Digital signatures
	•	Append-only logs
	•	Write-once records

⸻

Integrity Assurance

Definition
Integrity assurance is the degree of confidence that integrity protections are correctly implemented, enforced, and verifiable.

This is the difference between:
	•	“We hash files”
and
	•	“We can prove the hash is meaningful, enforced, and auditable”

Integrity assurance depends on:
	•	Key management
	•	Algorithm strength
	•	Enforcement boundaries
	•	Auditability
	•	Resistance to bypass

In high-assurance systems
Integrity assurance is a system property, not a single mechanism.

⸻

Authenticity

Definition
Authenticity is the assurance that an artifact is genuinely what it claims to be.

Authenticity answers:
“Is this really from who or what it claims?”

Authenticity requires:
	•	Identity binding
	•	Provenance or attestation
	•	Integrity

Courts often reject evidence due to failure to authenticate, even when integrity exists.

⸻

Non-repudiation

Definition
Non-repudiation is the ability to prevent an entity from credibly denying a prior action.

In practice
This is achieved through:
	•	Digital signatures
	•	Secure key custody
	•	Trusted timestamps
	•	Audit records

Important nuance
Non-repudiation is a legal and procedural property, enabled by cryptography but not guaranteed by it alone.

⸻

Chain of Custody

Definition
Chain of custody is the documented and continuous control history of an artifact from creation or acquisition to final disposition.

Chain of custody answers:
“Who had control of this, when, and under what authority?”

In digital systems
Chain of custody requires:
	•	Integrity protection of the artifact
	•	Integrity protection of custody records
	•	Explicit transfer events
	•	No silent handoffs

This is where many unclassified systems fail.

⸻

Custody vs Content Trust (important distinction)

Custody trust
	•	“This artifact has not changed since we received it”

Content trust
	•	“This artifact is accurate, valid, or correct”

High-assurance systems must separate these concepts.

You can trust custody while explicitly not trusting content.

This distinction is critical to UMRS.

⸻

Auditability

Definition
Auditability is the ability to reconstruct events and decisions after the fact with sufficient fidelity to support accountability.

Auditability requires:
	•	Complete records
	•	Meaningful semantics
	•	Stable identifiers
	•	Integrity protection

Audit logs that cannot answer “who, what, when, why” are compliance theater, not auditability.

⸻

Assurance (general term)

Definition
Assurance is confidence justified by evidence, not belief.

In high-assurance engineering:
	•	Assurance is earned
	•	Assurance is bounded
	•	Assurance degrades if controls are bypassed or unverifiable

This is why MLS, FIPS, and NIST frameworks focus on evidence, not intent.

⸻

Why this matters (the meta-point)

Most non-classified systems fail because they:
	•	Conflate provenance with trust
	•	Conflate integrity with correctness
	•	Treat attestation as implicit rather than explicit
	•	Log events without making them authoritative

What you are building with UMRS is essentially:
	•	Making these terms real, enforceable, and auditable
	•	Instead of vague, assumed, or social

If you want, next we can:
	•	Produce a glossary section suitable for UMRS documentation, or
	•	Map each term to specific NIST 800-53 controls, or
	•	Define which terms UMRS explicitly does and does not claim (very powerful in audits).
