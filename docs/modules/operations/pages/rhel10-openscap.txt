Opens cap 

Plain text as requested.

Here is the correct, simple, and high-assurance way to download and install OpenSCAP and SCAP Security Guide (SSG) profiles on RHEL 10.

This procedure assumes you are using standard Red Hat repos and want the official compliance profiles (STIG, CIS, PCI-DSS, OSPP, etc.).

⸻

	1.	INSTALL THE REQUIRED PACKAGES

⸻

On RHEL 10, the packages are still named the same as RHEL 8/9:

yum install -y openscap-scanner scap-security-guide

This gives you:

• oscap (the scanner)
• all compliance content under /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/
• all profiles for RHEL10 (STIG, CIS, ANSSI, PCI-DSS, C2S, etc.)

If your system does not have access to Red Hat repos, you must first:

subscription-manager register
subscription-manager attach

Then enable the correct repo:

subscription-manager repos –enable=rhel-10-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms
subscription-manager repos –enable=rhel-10-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms

Then re-run the install command.

⸻

	2.	VERIFY WHERE PROFILES ARE LOCATED

⸻

SCAP profiles are stored here:

/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/

For RHEL 10, the main file is expected to be something like:

ssg-rhel10-ds.xml
ssg-rhel10-xccdf.xml
ssg-rhel10-oval.xml

(Exact filenames may vary slightly depending on SSG version.)

To list all available profiles:

oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel10-ds.xml

This will show names such as:

• xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig
• xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_pci-dss
• xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis
• xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_c2s
• xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp

⸻

	3.	SCAN YOUR SYSTEM USING A PROFILE

⸻

Example: STIG scan

oscap xccdf eval 
–profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig 
–results results-stig.xml 
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel10-ds.xml

Example: CIS scan

oscap xccdf eval 
–profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cis 
–results results-cis.xml 
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel10-ds.xml

Example: PCI-DSS scan

oscap xccdf eval 
–profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_pci-dss 
–results results-pci.xml 
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel10-ds.xml

⸻

	4.	GENERATE AN HTML REPORT

⸻

oscap xccdf generate report results-stig.xml > stig-report.html

Open the HTML file in a browser.

⸻

	5.	OPTIONAL: REMEDIATE YOUR SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY

⸻

oscap xccdf eval 
–profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig 
–remediate 
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel10-ds.xml

Important note:
Automatic remediation can be aggressive.
Best practice: review the results first.

⸻

	6.	OPTIONAL: DOWNLOAD UPDATED PROFILES MANUALLY

⸻

If you want the newest SCAP content from the upstream project:

curl -LO https://static.open-scap.org/ssg-rhel10-ds-latest.xml

Then run:

oscap info ssg-rhel10-ds-latest.xml

This is useful for disconnected or hardened environments.

⸻

	7.	VERIFY CONTENT SIGNATURES (GOOD PRACTICE)

⸻

All SCAP content from Red Hat is usually signed with GPG.

rpm -q –qf “%{SIGPGP:pgpsig}\n” scap-security-guide

If verifying external content:

gpg –verify ssg-rhel10-ds-latest.xml.asc ssg-rhel10-ds-latest.xml

⸻

SHORT SUMMARY YOU CAN USE IN TRAINING OR YOUTUBE

“On RHEL 10, install OpenSCAP with ‘yum install openscap-scanner scap-security-guide.’
All compliance profiles are stored under /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/, including STIG, CIS, PCI-DSS, and C2S. Use ‘oscap info’ to list profiles and ‘oscap xccdf eval’ to scan or remediate your system.”

⸻

If you want, I can also create:

• a hardened RHEL 10 Kickstart that includes SCAP integration
• a mapping of SCAP → CCE → NIST 800-53 controls
• a baseline scanning script for your environment
• a full compliance workflow for YouTube or training content

Just tell me the direction.
