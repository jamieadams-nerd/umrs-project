# Suggested Cryptographic Keys for the System

	1.	Audit log signing key
(THIS IS STRICTLY auditd OUTPUT)

⸻

What data is being signed
	•	Binary audit records generated by the Linux Audit Framework (auditd)
	•	These are security event records, not general logs

Typical artifact paths
	•	/var/log/audit/audit.log (if using text dispatcher)
	•	/var/log/audit/audit.log.* (rotated)
	•	/var/log/audit/*.log (all audit trails)
	•	If using au-remote / dispatcher:
	•	data streams produced by audisp modules before off-host transfer

What is explicitly not included
	•	journald logs
	•	syslog logs
	•	application logs
	•	kernel messages outside audit framework

Purpose of this key
	•	Ensure audit trail integrity
	•	Detect tampering after generation
	•	Preserve forensic reliability

Why it must be a dedicated key
	•	AU-9 / AU-10 require audit data to be independently protected
	•	Audit logs cannot share keys with application or system logs

Summary line you can reuse
“Audit signing keys are used exclusively to sign files produced by auditd under /var/log/audit and are not shared with any other logging or system function.”

⸻

	2.	System / application log signing key
(NON-AUDIT LOGS – INTERNAL SYSTEM RECORDS)

⸻

What data is being signed
This key covers non-audit operational logs, including:
	•	Application logs
	•	Service logs
	•	Daemon logs
	•	Custom application logging

Typical artifact paths
Depends on logging architecture, but commonly:
	•	/var/log/messages (syslog legacy)
	•	/var/log/syslog (if enabled)
	•	/var/log/secure
	•	/var/log/maillog
	•	/var/log/httpd/*
	•	/var/log/nginx/*
	•	/var/log/<application_name>/*
	•	/var/log/journal/* (only if exporting to files)

Important distinction
	•	journald internally seals its own journal files
	•	journald sealing ≠ external cryptographic signing
	•	If journal files are exported, archived, or moved, this key applies

What is not included
	•	auditd output (/var/log/audit)
	•	Archived bundles (see next key)

Purpose of this key
	•	Detect tampering with operational logs
	•	Provide integrity prior to archival or forwarding
	•	Support incident response and troubleshooting trust

Summary line
“System and application log signing keys protect non-audit operational logs generated under /var/log, excluding files owned by auditd.”

⸻

	3.	Log archive signing key
(POST-ROTATION / BUNDLED ARTIFACTS)

⸻

What data is being signed
	•	Bundles or compressed sets of logs
	•	Immutable artifacts prepared for long-term storage or transfer

Typical artifact paths
Examples (depends on implementation):
	•	/var/log/archive/*
	•	/var/log/archives/*
	•	/var/backups/logs/*
	•	/srv/log-archive/*
	•	Temporary artifacts:
	•	/var/tmp/log-archive-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz
	•	*.tar.gz, *.xz, *.zip produced by logrotate hooks

These artifacts often contain:
	•	audit logs
	•	system logs
	•	application logs

Important rule
	•	Archive signing happens after rotation
	•	It signs the container, not individual log files
	•	Prior signatures must remain verifiable

Purpose of this key
	•	Preserve chain of custody
	•	Prove archive integrity after leaving the host
	•	Support long-term forensic retention

Why this is separate
	•	Rotation cadence differs
	•	Archive lifetime is often much longer
	•	Private key exposure risk differs

Summary line
“Archive signing keys protect packaged log artifacts prepared for off-system storage or retention and are distinct from per-log signing keys.”

⸻

	4.	Integrity verification / baseline signing key
(FILE-INTEGRITY / MLS SYSTEM TRUST)

⸻

What data is being signed
	•	Integrity baselines
	•	File hashes
	•	Expected-good state definitions

Typical artifact paths
Depending on mechanism:

IMA/EVM:
	•	/etc/ima/keys/*
	•	Measurement data under:
	•	/sys/kernel/security/ima/
	•	Hashes of:
	•	/bin
	•	/sbin
	•	/usr/bin
	•	/usr/sbin
	•	/etc (config files)

Custom baseline tools:
	•	/var/lib/integrity-baseline/*
	•	/etc/integrity/*
	•	/var/lib/aide/*

What is not included
	•	Logs
	•	Dynamic runtime data

Purpose of this key
	•	Detect unauthorized modification of binaries or configuration
	•	Support SI-7 and CM integrity requirements
	•	Anchor MLS trust decisions

Summary line
“Integrity signing keys protect cryptographic baselines used to validate the system’s executable and configuration state and are not used for logging or archival purposes.”

⸻

	5.	Secure Boot / platform trust keys
(ONLY IF IN SCOPE)

⸻

What data is being signed / verified
	•	Bootloaders
	•	Kernel images
	•	Kernel modules

Typical artifact locations
	•	Firmware databases (not typical file paths):
	•	UEFI db
	•	UEFI dbx
	•	On disk:
	•	/boot/efi/*
	•	/boot/vmlinuz-*
	•	/boot/initramfs-*

Notes
	•	Usually manufacturer- or org-managed
	•	Often out of scope for application-level key tooling

Summary line
“Platform trust keys establish a chain of trust from firmware through kernel boot and are managed separately from OS-level signing keys.”

⸻

	6.	TLS / service authentication keys
(INVENTORIED, NOT LOG-SIGNING)

⸻

What data is being signed
	•	TLS sessions
	•	Authentication handshakes
	•	Service identity assertions

Typical artifact paths
	•	/etc/pki/tls/private/*.key
	•	/etc/pki/tls/certs/*.crt
	•	/etc/ssl/private/*

What is not covered
	•	Log integrity
	•	Audit integrity

Purpose
	•	Confidentiality and authentication
	•	NOT forensic record integrity

Summary line
“TLS private keys are inventoried as cryptographic material but are not used for log or audit signing purposes.”

⸻

	7.	Package / artifact verification keys
(CONSUMER TRUST)

⸻

What data is verified (not signed locally)
	•	RPM packages
	•	Updates
	•	External artifacts

Typical artifact paths
	•	/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/*
	•	/etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo

Purpose
	•	Supply-chain integrity
	•	Installation trust

Summary line
“Package verification keys validate external software artifacts and are distinct from system-originated signing keys.”

⸻

	8.	Minimal system-required signing keys (explicit)

⸻

For a serious MLS / high-assurance system, a defensible minimum is:
	1.	Audit log signing key
	•	/var/log/audit/*
	2.	System/application log signing key
	•	/var/log/* (non-audit)
	3.	Log archive signing key
	•	/var/log/archive/*
	•	/srv/log-archive/*
	4.	Integrity baseline signing key (if integrity monitoring is enabled)

Everything else is inventoried, not necessarily generated.
