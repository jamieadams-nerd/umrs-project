= IBM Z and zOS 
Jamie L. Adams


IBM Z
	•	Hardware platform (mainframes)
	•	Formerly called zSeries
	•	Can run multiple, very different operating systems

z/OS
	•	Not Linux
	•	IBM’s flagship mainframe operating system
	•	Descended from OS/360 → MVS → OS/390 → z/OS
	•	Completely different kernel, APIs, tooling, and security model
	•	Optimized for:
	•	Massive batch processing
	•	Transaction processing (CICS)
	•	High-reliability enterprise workloads
	•	Uses things like:
	•	JCL (Job Control Language)
	•	RACF (or equivalent) for security
	•	EBCDIC internally (historically significant)


Linux on IBM Z (often called “Linux on Z” or “s390x Linux”)
	•	This is Linux
	•	Standard Linux kernel ported to IBM Z hardware
	•	Same Linux userspace concepts you know:
	•	systemd
	•	GNU tools
	•	Bash
	•	SELinux
	•	Architecturally:
	•	Runs on the s390x CPU architecture
	•	Supports RHEL, SLES, Ubuntu, etc.
	•	Often runs alongside z/OS on the same physical mainframe using virtualization (LPARs, z/VM)

So the relationship looks like this:
	•	IBM Z → hardware
	•	z/OS → proprietary IBM mainframe OS (not Linux)
	•	Linux on Z → real Linux, just on mainframe hardware

Why people get confused
	•	IBM Z can run Linux
	•	z/OS can host UNIX-like environments (z/OS UNIX)
	•	Both coexist on the same machine
	•	But z/OS ≠ Linux, not even close internally

High-assurance parallel (why this matters in your world)
z/OS security concepts (RACF, dataset controls, job classes) feel more like:
	•	MLS systems
	•	Mandatory access control
	•	Strong operational separation

Linux on Z, by contrast, behaves like:
	•	RHEL on x86
	•	Same SELinux concepts
	•	Same hardening practices

So if someone says:
	•	“IBM mainframe runs Linux” → sometimes true
	•	“z/OS is Linux” → false


## Linux on IBM Z

There isn’t one Linux flavor on IBM Z — it supports multiple standard Linux distributions, built specifically for the s390x architecture.

The primary, officially supported ones are:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) for IBM Z
	•	Architecture: s390x
	•	Fully supported by Red Hat and IBM
	•	Same RHEL you know:
	•	systemd
	•	SELinux
	•	DNF/YUM
	•	FIPS mode
	•	Very common in regulated and enterprise environments

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) for IBM Z
	•	Architecture: s390x
	•	Longstanding IBM partnership
	•	Strong presence in banking and finance
	•	Also supports SELinux (and AppArmor)

Ubuntu Server for IBM Z
	•	Architecture: s390x
	•	Supported by Canonical
	•	Often used for cloud-native and dev workloads
	•	Same Ubuntu userspace, just a different CPU architecture

Others (more limited / community / historical)
	•	Debian (s390x) — community supported
	•	Fedora (s390x) — exists but not typically used in production on Z
	•	Rocky / Alma — not commonly supported on IBM Z as of now (ecosystem focus is RHEL/SLES/Ubuntu)

Key point (important for your world)
Linux on IBM Z is not a fork or special IBM Linux.

It is:
	•	The standard Linux kernel
	•	Standard distributions
	•	Recompiled for the s390x architecture
	•	With mainframe-specific drivers and virtualization support

Conceptually:
	•	RHEL on x86_64
	•	RHEL on aarch64
	•	RHEL on s390x (IBM Z)

Same distro, different CPU.

What IBM adds
IBM provides:
	•	Hardware enablement
	•	Crypto accelerators
	•	I/O drivers
	•	Virtualization layers (LPAR, z/VM, KVM on Z)

But the OS distribution itself is still Red Hat / SUSE / Canonical.

So if you were writing UMRS docs, the correct phrasing would be:

“Linux on IBM Z runs standard enterprise Linux distributions (such as RHEL, SLES, or Ubuntu) built for the s390x architecture.”
