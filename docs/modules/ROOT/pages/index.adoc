== What this documentation is
This documentation is written for two audiences:

1. Administrators who build and operate the UMRS reference workstation.
2. Users who need to understand expected behaviors and safe usage patterns.

// . Title page
// . Abstract / Overview
// . Scope and Audience
// . Prerequisites / Assumptions
// . Installation Procedures
// . Configuration Procedures
// . Operational Notes
// . Configuration Rationale (your rationale sections)
// . Security Considerations (if applicable)
// . Appendices (optional, technical deep dives)
// . Legal Notices (license + trademarks)

== Documentation sets
* Web documentation: versioned static site (Antora).
* PDFs: offline guides stored on the workstation (generated from the same sources).
* Man pages: authoritative command reference for UMRS tooling.

Here is the clean mapping that aligns with everything we discussed.

index.adoc
Contains:

Title page

Abstract / Overview

Scope and Audience

High-level architecture summary

Scope and Audience

Then separate pages for the rest.

ifdef::internal[]
Example Antora pages directory:

pages/
index.adoc
prerequisites.adoc
installation.adoc
configuration.adoc
operations.adoc
rationale.adoc
security.adoc
appendices/
appendix-a-labels.adoc
appendix-b-threats.adoc
legal.adoc
endif::[]

Now map those to your outline:

Prerequisites / Assumptions
→ prerequisites.adoc

Installation Procedures
→ installation.adoc

Configuration Procedures
→ configuration.adoc

Operational Notes
→ operations.adoc

Configuration Rationale
→ rationale.adoc

Security Considerations
→ security.adoc

Appendices
→ appendices/*.adoc

Legal Notices
→ legal.adoc

Where nav.adoc fits (this is usually the missing link)

nav.adoc controls the left-hand navigation.
It does NOT define content.
It only defines ordering and visibility.

Example nav.adoc (simplified):

xref:index.adoc[Overview]
xref:prerequisites.adoc[Prerequisites]
xref:installation.adoc[Installation]
xref:configuration.adoc[Configuration]
xref:operations.adoc[Operations]
xref:rationale.adoc[Design Rationale]
xref:security.adoc[Security Considerations]

Appendices
** xref:appendices/appendix-a-labels.adoc[Label Registry]
** xref:appendices/appendix-b-threats.adoc[Threat Model]

xref:legal-notices.adoc[Legal Notices]

This is where the 11-section outline becomes visible and coherent.
